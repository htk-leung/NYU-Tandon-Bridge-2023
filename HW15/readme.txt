Focus of week 15 was linked list and file I/O.
This directory contains solution to the following problem:

Imagine a group of friends went out to dinner together. 
When the bill comes they all give different amounts to contribute to the total, 
but after wish to balance everything out equally 
so that each person pays the same amount. 

Knowing how much each person is supposed to pay is simple enough, 
just add up all the amounts paid and divide by the number of people; 
but that doesnâ€™t tell anyone how to go about distributing the payments, 
who should give what amount to whom?

Write a program that will print out a step by step list of instructions 
of how to reimburse everyone given the name of the person and amount of money they paid. 
This program should prompt the user to enter a file name associated with the info, 
which will then be read in. 
All information from the external file should be read into a linked list.
